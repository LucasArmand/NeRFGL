# NeRFGL
NeRFGL is an implementation of the NeRF rendering method using OpenGL, 
using compute and fragment shaders for GPU accelerated ML.
## Capabilities
- Given a set of images of a scene with defined camera transforms, trains a model
to render that scene.
- Given a trained model, renders a camera view to an interactive window
- Given a trained model and a camera path, renders a video of the camera path
